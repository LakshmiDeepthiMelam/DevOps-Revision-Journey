## 📘 1. Version Control System Overview

A **Version Control System (VCS)** helps teams manage changes to code and track history across versions.
It enables developers to:

* Work together on different parts of a project.
* Roll back to previous versions when bugs appear.
* Maintain a clean audit trail of who changed what and why.

> 💡 In DevOps, VCS is the backbone for automation and collaboration — every build and deployment starts from Git.

---

## 📘 2. Centralized vs Distributed VCS

| Type                   | Examples       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Centralized (CVCS)** | SVN, CVS       | One central server stores all code. If the server is down, no one can commit or retrieve updates.                                    |
| **Distributed (DVCS)** | Git, Mercurial | Each developer has a full copy of the repository. Developers can work offline and sync later, eliminating a single point of failure. |

---

## 📘 3. Git Basics and Architecture

### `.git` Folder Contents

When you run `git init`, Git creates a hidden folder `.git/` that stores all metadata and history.

* **HEAD** → Points to the current branch or commit.
* **objects/** → Stores actual content (blobs, trees, commits).
* **refs/** → Pointers to branches and tags.
* **config** → Repository settings.
* **hooks/** → Scripts that run on events (e.g., pre-commit).

> ⚙️ In DevOps pipelines, hooks can block commits with secrets or enforce formatting rules.

## 📘 5. Essential Commands with Examples

| Command                   | Purpose                       | Example                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `git init`                | Initialize a new repo         | `git init`                        |
| `git status`              | Check tracked/untracked files | `git status`                      |
| `git add .`               | Stage all changes             | `git add .`                       |
| `git commit -m "msg"`     | Save snapshot                 | `git commit -m "added login API"` |
| `git log --oneline`       | Show commit history           | `git log --oneline --graph`       |
| `git diff`                | View unstaged changes         | `git diff`                        |
| `git reset --hard <hash>` | Roll back to commit           | `git reset --hard abc123`         |
| `git rm`                  | Delete file from repo         | `git rm secrets.txt`              |

---

## 📘 6. Practical Workflow Example

**Scenario:** You’re assigned to add a division function to a calculator script.

```bash
git init
git add calculator.sh
git commit -m "Initial commit with addition feature"
```

Modify the script → `git add calculator.sh` → `git commit -m "Added division feature"`.
You now have two versions of your file stored in Git history.

> 💡 In DevOps, this mirrors how teams iterate on Jenkinsfiles or Helm charts and rollback if a deployment fails.

---

## 📘 7. Branching and Strategies

Branching allows parallel development without impacting the main code.

### Common Branches

* **main** → Stable, production-ready.
* **feature/** → For new feature work.
* **release/** → Pre-deployment testing.
* **hotfix/** → Urgent production fixes.

### Example

```
(main)---A---B---C---------
           \
            feature-login---D---E
```

Commands:

```bash
git branch feature-login
git checkout feature-login
# work, commit, test
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

---

### ASCII Branching Workflow

```
Developer creates feature branch → commits code → tests → merges to main → CI/CD pipeline deploys artifact
```

---

## 📘 8. Merge vs Rebase – Detailed Explanation

### **Merge**

* Combines histories; keeps true timeline.
* Safe for shared branches.

### **Rebase**

* Rewrites commits to appear linear.
* Cleaner history but avoid on shared branches.

#### Example

```
Before:
A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature)

Merge:
A---B---C---M
     \     /
      D---E

Rebase:
A---B---C---D'---E'
```

**Conflict Example**

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
old logic
=======
new logic
>>>>>>> feature
```

Fix the file → `git add .` → `git commit`.

> 🧠 Real world: Different teams edit same Terraform file — resolve conflicts via team discussion before merge.

---

## 📘 9. Cherry-Pick and Hotfix Use Case

**Cherry-Pick:** apply a specific commit from one branch to another.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-id>
```

**Example:**
Critical fix in `feature-payment` needs to go live → cherry-pick commit onto `main` → deploy.

---

## 📘 10. Fork vs Clone & SSH Setup

| Action    | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clone** | Local copy of existing repo → `git clone <url>`   |
| **Fork**  | Personal copy on GitHub to contribute back via PR |

**SSH Steps**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Add public key to GitHub > Settings > SSH Keys
ssh -T git@github.com
```

---

## 📘 11. Remotes and Push Workflow

```bash
git remote add origin <repo URL>
git remote -v
git push -u origin main
git pull origin main
```

Typical sequence: `git add` → `git commit` → `git push` → CI/CD build triggered.

---

## 📘 12. Real-World DevOps Scenarios

1. **Team Development:**
   Each developer creates a feature branch; QA tests on release branch; DevOps merges and deploys.

2. **Hotfix Flow:**

   ```
   main → hotfix/payment-bug → test → merge → production
   ```

3. **Rollback:**

   ```
   git tag v1.2
   git checkout v1.1
   ```

---

## 📘 13. Git in CI/CD Pipelines

* Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI detect `git push` and run builds.
* Branch-based deployment policies:

  * `develop` → staging.
  * `main` → production.

Example GitHub Actions:

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Build triggered by Git commit"
```

---

## 📘 14. GitOps and IaC

**GitOps** = manage infrastructure through Git.

* Git is the single source of truth.
* Argo CD/Flux watch repo and sync to Kubernetes.

ASCII Flow:

```
Developer → Commit → GitHub → ArgoCD → Kubernetes Cluster


## 📘 **15. Common Git Interview Topics (with Answers)**


### **1️⃣ What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

* **Git** is an open-source **version control system** used to track and manage changes in source code.
* **GitHub** is a **cloud-based hosting platform** that uses Git for version control and adds collaboration features like issues, pull requests, CI/CD integration, and team management.

> 💡 Think of Git as a local engine and GitHub as the garage where you share your projects with others.

---

### **2️⃣ Explain the difference between Merge and Rebase.**

| Feature            | Merge                                         | Rebase                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**        | Combines changes from one branch into another | Moves commits to appear on top of another branch |
| **Commit History** | Keeps full history (non-linear)               | Creates a linear history                         |
| **Safety**         | Safe for shared/public branches               | Should be used for personal branches             |
| **Command**        | `git merge branch-name`                       | `git rebase branch-name`                         |

**Example:**
If you have `main` and `feature` branches,

* `git merge feature` → Combines both histories.
* `git rebase feature` → Rewrites commits to follow the latest from `main`.

> 💬 Use **merge** for shared repos, and **rebase** for your own local cleanups.

---

### **3️⃣ What is a Hotfix Branch?**

A **hotfix branch** is created when a critical issue occurs in production that needs to be fixed immediately without waiting for the next release.

**Workflow:**

```
main → hotfix/payment-bug → test → merge → deploy
```

**Commands:**

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-bug
# fix code
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed payment gateway timeout"
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/payment-bug
```

> ⚙️ In DevOps teams, hotfix branches are often connected to CI/CD pipelines that deploy instantly once merged.

---

### **4️⃣ What is the difference between Fork and Clone?**

| Action    | Description                                             | Use Case                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Clone** | Creates a local copy of a remote repository.            | Used when you’re working on an existing repo. |
| **Fork**  | Creates a copy of a repo under your own GitHub account. | Used to contribute to someone else’s project. |

**Analogy:**
Cloning is like downloading your own copy to work on.
Forking is like copying a project on GitHub to propose your changes to the original owner.

---

### **5️⃣ Describe the Git Lifecycle.**

Git has three main areas:

1. **Working Directory** – where you modify files.
2. **Staging Area (Index)** – where you prepare files for a commit using `git add`.
3. **Local Repository** – where snapshots are saved using `git commit`.
4. **Remote Repository** – hosted on platforms like GitHub via `git push`.

```
Working Directory → (git add) → Staging → (git commit) → Local Repo → (git push) → Remote Repo
```

> 💡 In CI/CD, Git lifecycle integrates directly with pipelines — each commit can trigger builds and deployments.

---

### **6️⃣ How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?**

**Merge Conflict:** Happens when two branches change the same part of a file.

**Conflict Marker Example:**

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
main branch content
=======
feature branch content
>>>>>>> feature
```

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Open the file and manually choose the correct lines.
2. Save the file after editing.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit
   ```

> 💬 Communication is key — in team projects, always discuss before finalizing conflicting logic.

---

### **7️⃣ When would you use Git Cherry-Pick?**

**`git cherry-pick <commit-id>`** allows you to copy specific commits from one branch to another.

**Example Scenario:**
A developer fixed a critical bug in the `develop` branch that also exists in `main`.
Instead of merging the whole branch, cherry-pick that commit only.

> ⚙️ Common in production environments where you want only certain fixes, not all changes.

---

### **8️⃣ What happens when you clone a repository?**

When you run:

```bash
git clone <repo-URL>
```

Git performs:

1. Downloads all files and history to your local system.
2. Creates a `.git` folder for metadata.
3. Automatically sets the remote reference `origin`.

> 🧠 After cloning, you can create new branches, commit changes, and push to your fork or remote repository.

---

### **9️⃣ How can you revert or undo commits?**

**To undo the last commit but keep changes locally:**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

**To undo the last commit and discard changes:**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**To revert a specific commit (without altering history):**

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```

> 💡 In production pipelines, `git revert` is safer since it preserves history and is audit-friendly.

---

### **🔟 What is GitOps and how does it relate to DevOps?**

**GitOps** = “Operations through Git.”
It applies DevOps principles using Git as the **single source of truth** for infrastructure and application configuration.

**Core Concepts:**

* All infra and app states are versioned in Git.
* Pull Requests are used to propose changes.
* Tools like **ArgoCD** or **FluxCD** watch the repo and sync clusters automatically.

**Workflow:**

```
Developer → Commit → GitHub → ArgoCD → Kubernetes Cluster
```

> ⚙️ GitOps ensures reliability, traceability, and automated recovery in cloud environments.

---

### **1️⃣1️⃣ What’s the role of Git in CI/CD?**

* Git triggers CI/CD pipelines whenever changes are pushed.
* CI tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) use Git webhooks to start builds.
* Each commit can correspond to a build, test, or deployment stage.

**Example GitHub Actions file:**

```yaml
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "Deploy triggered from Git push"
```

> 💡 In DevOps, Git is not just for code — it controls infrastructure, configurations, and automation workflows.

---

### **1️⃣2️⃣ How can you ensure code safety in Git repositories?**

* Use **`.gitignore`** to exclude credentials, temp files, or logs.
* Use **pre-commit hooks** to prevent sensitive data pushes.
* Apply **branch protection rules** in GitHub to require reviews before merging.
* Always use **SSH keys or tokens** for authentication.

---

### **1️⃣3️⃣ What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?**

| Command     | Description                                                            | Example                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `git fetch` | Retrieves latest commits from remote but does not merge automatically. | `git fetch origin`     |
| `git pull`  | Fetches and merges in one step.                                        | `git pull origin main` |

> 💬 In CI/CD, `git fetch` is often used first for safer, controlled updates.

---

### **1️⃣4️⃣ What is the difference between `git reset` and `git revert`?**

| Command        | Effect                                                                                                        | Use Case                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **git reset**  | Moves HEAD pointer to previous commit, discarding or keeping changes depending on flags (`--soft`, `--hard`). | Local history cleanup.        |
| **git revert** | Creates a new commit that undoes previous changes.                                                            | Safe for public repositories. |

> ⚠️ Never use `git reset --hard` on shared branches — it rewrites history.

---

### **1️⃣5️⃣ What is a Detached HEAD state?**

A **Detached HEAD** occurs when you checkout a specific commit instead of a branch:

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

You’re no longer on a branch — any commits you make will be lost unless you create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch
```

> 🧩 Always create a new branch when experimenting to avoid losing work.

---

### **1️⃣6️⃣ What is a Tag and when to use it?**

**Tags** mark specific commits as versions or releases.
Example:

```bash
git tag v1.0 -m "Stable release"
git push origin v1.0
```

> 🏷️ Tags are widely used in DevOps release pipelines for versioning Docker images or artifacts.

---

### **1️⃣7️⃣ How do you handle large repositories efficiently?**

* Use **shallow clones** for limited history: `git clone --depth 1 <repo>`.
* Clean up old branches: `git branch -d branch-name`.
* Compress objects: `git gc`.
* Avoid committing binaries — use artifact storage (e.g., AWS S3, Artifactory).

---

### **1️⃣8️⃣ What is `.gitignore` and why is it important?**

`.gitignore` specifies files or directories that Git should not track.

**Example:**

```
# Ignore build and logs
/build
/logs
*.env
*.pem
```

> 💡 In CI/CD, `.gitignore` prevents unnecessary files from being deployed or triggering builds.


## 📘 16. Best Practices

* Keep `main` always stable.
* Write meaningful commit messages.
* Pull before push to avoid conflicts.
* Don’t rebase shared branches.
* Use `.gitignore`.
* Protect credentials via SSH keys.
* Delete old branches: `git branch -d name`.
* Tag stable releases: `git tag v1.0`.
